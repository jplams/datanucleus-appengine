A note about running tests:

Unless you want to add bytecode enhancement as a post-compilation step you must pass the following
flag to the jvm in order for the tests to pass:

-javaagent:lib/datanucleus-enhancer-1.1.4.jar=org.datanucleus.test

This tells Datanucleus to perform runtime enhancement on any classes it encounters that live in the
org.datanucleus.test package.  The enhancer ignores classes in org.datanucleus unless
the package is org.datanucleus.test, so you'll be happiest if you just put all the classes
you want enhanced in this package.
