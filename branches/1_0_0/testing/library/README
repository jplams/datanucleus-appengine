An application that uses JDO, JPA, or native AppEngine API.
The application can be tested with Selenium core by loading
http://localhost:8085/core/TestRunner.html?test=..%2Ftests%2FTestSuite.html in a
browser.

Initial set-up is required for Selenium tests:
cd testing/library/tools
./initPromLibrary.py -u http://localhost:8085/library

Because JDO uses all capital letters for kind and property names while the BookDataService using native datastore keeps the original cases, we need to load this url in browser:
http://kjin-library.prom.corp.google.com/setDataServiceName?DataServiceName=Native
(This changes the BookDataService implementation to native mode.)
Then run the command again:
./initPromLibrary.py -u http://localhost:8085/library
Now tests data for all 3 implementations are initialized.
