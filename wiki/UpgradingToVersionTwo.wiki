= Installation =

= Configuration =
We have removed the App Engine specific JDO and JPA providers in V2, so you'll need to edit your config files as follows:

In jdoconfig.xml, the value of `javax.jdo.PersistenceManagerFactoryClass`
should now be `org.datanucleus.api.jdo.JDOPersistenceManagerFactory`.

In persistence.xml, the value of `provider` should now be `org.datanucleus.api.jpa.PersistenceProviderImpl`.
