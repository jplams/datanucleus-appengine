The major change with version 2 is to use DataNucleus v3.x. This brings with it some significant changes.
* Level2 Caching is enabled by default. 
  Set persistence property "datanucleus.cache.level2.type" to "none" to get the previous behaviour.
* Datastore IdentifierFactory has changed to default to "datanucleus2". 
  Set persistence property "datanucleus.identifierFactory" to "datanucleus1" to get the previous behaviour.
* "javax.persistence.query.chunkSize" is no longer used (invalid name anyway). Use "datanucleus.query.fetchSize" instead.
* There is now no longer an exception on duplicate PMF allocation. Instead if you have the persistence property
  "datanucleus.singletonPMFForName" set to "true" then it will return the currently allocated singleton PMF for that name.
* There is now no longer an exception on duplicate EMF allocation. Instead if you have the persistence property
  "datanucleus.singletonEMFForName" set to "true" then it will return the currently allocated singleton EMF for that name.
