        Package providing mappings for all supported Java types in DataNucleus. 
        A JavaTypeMapping provides a mapping from the Java type to the associated RDBMS type(s). 
        At the class side we have a field, and at the datastore side we have datastore column(s).
        This should beused by RDBMS only. Currently Google BigTable uses some code from here but that will be 
        removed in time.
        <b>DO NOT USE THIS PACKAGE (AND SUBPACKAGES) ON ANY NON-RDBMS DATASTORE</b>
