    <p>
        This package provides classes for the management of datastores that are "mapped". This is typically just
        RDBMS. Currently Google BigTable uses some code from here but that will be removed in time.
        <b>DO NOT USE THIS PACKAGE (AND SUBPACKAGES) ON ANY NON-RDBMS DATASTORE</b>
